    <h1><i>Rosemary Lemon Cookies</i></h1>
    <p> Tired of the traditional chocolate chip <sub>boriiing</sub> cookies? Then you, my friend, are in luck! <br>
    After many, many hours on Tiktok i have finally found something interesting. <strong>Rosemary Lemon Cookies!</strong> <br> 
    How awesome does that sound?
    <br> I will share this amazing recipe by @Meggrowsplants.</p>

    <h2>The questionable combination of flavours...</h2>
    <p> Sweet, tarty, and balanced perfectly with rosemary’s earthiness, these cookies are sweet and savory all in one. <br>
    The combination might seem odd but its well balanced and full of rich, savoury and authentic flavour. In the past cooking <br>
was way different than what we are used to now. Many of the popular dishes unfortunately could not be found on Pinterest <br>
 now or even at any newly written cookbook. But some of these timeless combinations have survived. </p>

    <li>1 cup brown sugar</li>
    <li>2 egg yolks, lightly beaten</li>

</ul>

<h2>Recipe</h2>
<ol>
    <li>In the bowl of an electric mixer, cream together butter and brown sugar until smooth and fluffy, <br> 
        scraping the bowl as needed. Add the eggs, lemon zest, and lemon juice and beat until smooth. </li>
    <li>Sprinkle the salt, rosemary, and flour on top. Beat on low speed until the dough comes together and no streaks of flour remain. </li>
    <li>Pat the dough into a ball and set it on a piece of saran wrap. Wrap the dough up then pat it down into a rough <br>
        rectangle about a 1/2 inch thick with your hands. Refrigerate for at least 2 hours or up to 48 hours. </li>
    <li>When ready to bake, preheat the oven to 350 degrees. Line 2 baking sheets with parchment paper. Place the coarse sugar in a bowl.</li>
    <li>Lightly flour your counter top then place the dough on top. Flour a rolling pin, then roll your dough out to about 1/4 inch thick. <br>
    Using a cookie cutter or small juice glass, cut circles of dough out. Roll the edges of the dough in the coarse sugar then line up on the <br>
    parchment paper, spacing at least 1 inch apart. Re-roll and cut the dough until none remains. Bake for 8-10 minutes or until edges are very <br>
    light golden brown and centers look set. </li>
</ol>
